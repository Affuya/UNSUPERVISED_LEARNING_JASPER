# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on applying unsupervised learning techniques to a wholesale data dataset, aiming to uncover patterns and insights from the data. The project is structured into four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to utilize data visualization tools to communicate the derived insights effectively.

### Duration
Approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes

### Project Objectives
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Pre-processing:**
   - Import and clean the Wholesale Data dataset.
   - Analyze and visualize relationships between variables.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.

2. **Unsupervised Learning:**
   - Apply KMeans clustering to identify distinct patterns in the data.
   - Implement hierarchical clustering to explore hierarchical relationships.
   - Utilize PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

3. **Insights Communication:**
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters for each method.
   - Communicate insights gained through data visualization.
   - Evaluate and compare clustering methods based on silhouette scores.

### Project Steps
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Import and clean the Wholesale Data dataset.
   - Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's structure.

2. **Pre-processing:**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Perform feature engineering to enhance the dataset.

3. **KMeans Clustering:**
   - Apply KMeans clustering algorithm.
   - Evaluate the clustering performance using silhouette scores.

4. **Hierarchical Clustering:**
   - Implement hierarchical clustering algorithm.
   - Visualize the hierarchical relationships in the data.

5. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
   - Use PCA for dimensionality reduction.
   - Visualize the data in a reduced-dimensional space.

6. **Insights Communication:**
   - Communicate findings through clear visualizations.
   - Compare and contrast results from different clustering methods.

### Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive exploration of unsupervised learning techniques on the Wholesale Data dataset. Through effective data pre-processing, clustering algorithms, and visualization, the project aims to reveal meaningful patterns within the data. The insights gained can inform decision-making processes based on the identified clusters.
